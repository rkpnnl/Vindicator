function x2 = interval_avg(t1, x1, t2)
%{
Computes mean for high-rate data over intervals t2.

t1 and t2 are assumed to be 1-D.  x1 may be 2-D, in which case
the means are computed along columns, which must have the same
length as t1.  t2 represents interval bin edges.

Times are assumed to mark the start point of each interval.
HOWEVER, THE LAST VALUE OF T2 IS ASSUMED TO BE THE STOP POINT AND
NO AVG WILL BE COMPUTED FOR THIS VALUE.  THE RESULT ARRAY WILL
THEREFORE HAVE t2-1 ELEMENTS OR ROWS.

Uniform delta-t is not required in either t1 or t2, although in most
applications delta-t2 will be uniform.  Ranges of t1 and t2 must overlap,
but the start and end points for each time series may be different.
Intervals in t2 outside the range of t1 are set to NaN.

Returns t2(1:end-1) as first column of x2
